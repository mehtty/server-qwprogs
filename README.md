==================

New features
------
* `cmd votemap`/`cmd showvotes`/`cmd listmaps` can now be used at any time and are part of the same system
* new server command `vote_removemap <name>` removes them
* new server command `vote_addmap <name> <desc> [mapgroup] [num_teams] [min_players] [max_players]` can be used to add maps to the below menu
* `cmd mapmenu` brings up a map selection menu, which can then either be voted for or changed immediately, provided you have adminpwd/rcon set up
* localinfo vote_threshold 0.5 will set the portion of players required to win a vote
* scout has "new" flash grenades - localinfo fo_flash on (default off)
* ability to set client side min and max flash amounts - localinfo minflash x/localinfo maxflash x (number as a percentage - 1.5 = 150%)
* localinfo quad_roles 1 enables the use of quad roles. Only works in quad mode: Blue gets the "attack" role first and Red gets the "defence" role.
    These roles can be configured by adding the "att_" and "def_" prefix to localinfo settings. Only detpipe_limit, respawn_time, gren limits and class limits are currently supported.
    Use `cmd showroles` to see the current configuration.
    The team with the "attack" role also has its flag hidden to avoid confusion.
* localinfo keep_teams 1/2 - keeps teams upon map change. 1 = same team. 2 = rotate teams
